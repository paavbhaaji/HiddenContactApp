## HiddenContact: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Hidden Contact app for Android!

This is an Android app developed by Himadri Nayak.The app is available on Google Play Store.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data created by the you is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Himadri Nayak
